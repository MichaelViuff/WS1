# Debugging Plan

This document outlines a placeholder plan for debugging in this project.

## Overview

The purpose of this plan is to establish a structured approach to identifying, isolating, and resolving bugs during development.

## Steps

1. **Reproduce the Issue**
    - Document steps to consistently reproduce the bug.

2. **Isolate the Problem**
    - Narrow down the code or component causing the issue.

3. **Analyze and Hypothesize**
    - Review logs, error messages, and code to form hypotheses.

4. **Test Solutions**
    - Apply fixes and verify if the issue is resolved.

5. **Document Findings**
    - Record the bug, solution, and any relevant notes.

## Tools

- Debugger (IDE-integrated)
- Logging utilities
- Unit testing framework

## Best Practices

- Write clear, concise bug reports.
- Use version control for all changes.
- Communicate findings with the team.
